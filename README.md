## About the Data

Web scraping was performed on the _Top 10 Tech Channels_ on Youtube using _[Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)_ (an automated browser (driver) controlled using python, which is often used in web scraping and web testing).  The youtube channels to were scrapped were determined using a __[Top 10 Tech Youtubers](https://blog.bit.ai/top-tech-youtubers/)__ list from blog.bit.ai.  Scraping included:
* Channel names
* Number of subscribers per channel
* Data from most popular videos per channel included:
	* Video titles
	* Posting date
	* Number of views


The average number of videos per channel was around 200.  In total, the data from 2000 videos was scrapped.  All data was saved to a CSV file to aid in further analyze on a Google Colab notebook.
